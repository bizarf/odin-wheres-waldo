# The Odin Project - Project: Where's Waldo (A Photo Tagging App)

The goal of this project is to make a photo tagging app. It will contain a large photo with lots of elements on it, and the goal for the user is to find several listed characters or objects. When the user clicks on the photo, they will be given a dropdown menu and they can select one of the character or objects that they want to tag.
